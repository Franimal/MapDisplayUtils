# MapDisplayUtils

A java library to assist in displaying mapping data on a screen.  

The main class to be used for this is CoordinateMap.java, which is created
around a set of latitude/longitude coordinates, along with information about thescreen the data will be displayed on, as well as the radius (in metres) that
you wish to display.

You can then get the screen location of a latitude/longitude coordinate from the CoordinateMap, as well as manipulate how the map will be displayed by zooming/translating/rotating it.

Things to implement:  

Translating the map

Zooming the map

Rotating the map

Getting a screen point from a given coordinate
